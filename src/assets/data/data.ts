Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets.Mercury rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System.Its orbital eccentricity is the largest of all known planets in the Solar System.<br><br>It is the fastest planet in our solar system - traveling through space at nearly 29 miles (47 kilometers) per second.The closer a planet is to the Sun, the faster it travels. Since Mercury is the fastest planet and has the shortest distance to travel around the Sun, it has the shortest year of all the planets in our solar system - 88 days.There are no rings around Mercury. It is unlikely that life as we know it could survive on Mercury due to solar radiation, and extreme temperatures.<br><br>Standing on Mercury's surface at its closest approach to the Sun, our star would appear more than three times larger than it does on Earth.Two NASA missions have explored Mercury: Mariner 10 was the first to fly by Mercury, and MESSENGER was the first to orbit.

It’s one of the four inner, terrestrial (or rocky) planets, and it’s often called Earth’s twin because it’s similar in size and density. These are not identical twins, however – there are radical differences between the two worlds.Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and it’s perpetually shrouded in thick, yellowish clouds of sulfuric acid that trap heat, causing a runaway greenhouse effect.<br><br> It’s the hottest planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun. Surface temperatures on Venus are about 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475 degrees Celsius) – hot enough to melt lead. The surface is a rusty color and it’s peppered with intensely crunched mountains and thousands of large volcanoes. Scientists think it’s possible some volcanoes are still active.<br><br><br> <u> Specification of Mercury </u>:-<br><br>>>Second Planet from the Sun<br>>>Approximately 108,000,000 km from the Sun<br>>>Approximately 61 million km from the Earth<br>>>Mass: 4.867 × 10^24 kg<br>>>Volume: 9.33*10^19m^3<br>>>Average Radius: 6,051.8 km<br>>>Rotation(Earth days): 243 Earth days<br>>>Orbit(Earth years): 225 days<br>",

The ongoing contraction of Jupiter's interior generates more heat than the planet receives from the Sun.

It is not the only planet to have rings – made of chunks of ice and rock – but none are as spectacular or as complicated as Saturn's.Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium.<br><br>Saturn's interior is most likely composed of a rocky core, surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally, a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but which has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. <br><br>Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's.[28] The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear.
