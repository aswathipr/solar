<div class="container-med w-full px-6"><h2 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;text-align: center;color: rgba(254, 219, 198, 0.591);"><u>The Challenge</u></h2><p>Space is hard, and exploration takes a long time.</p><p>When a government decides to take on a project like returning samples from the surface of Mars or sending a probe to Jupiter’s moons, it doesn’t happen <br> overnight. From planning a mission to building, launching, and operating spacecraft, missions like these take decades to accomplish.<br> They need decades of sustained funding.</p><p>Although private companies are increasingly active in space, funding for space exploration still mostly comes from governments. This means that elected <br>representatives of the public make decisions about spending on space exploration and about which missions to undertake. It’s important to make sure <br> that government decision-makers and the people they represent understand the value of space exploration and support the investments needed to<br> make great discoveries.</p><p>Missions to explore other worlds also depend on advanced technologies and cutting-edge science, as well as international cooperation and collaboration. <br>With the right investments and the world’s best minds working together, we can ensure a bright&nbsp;future for space exploration.</p><p></div>
